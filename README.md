# LumberJack
There is a battle between two civilizations in our solar system. You are the last survivor on Earth and must defend the honor of our civilization. How? You must go and kill your opponents, you must become a merciless bloodthirsty monster like the stars never dreamed of.

The project was created for educational purposes by two high school students in Poland. The game is available for desktop devices, contact with the developers is possible on a private discord: https://discord.gg/ydHee5T8bh. The production is under development, so please wait for updates that will appear. The game should be completely finished by the end of August/beginning of September, but there is no definite date when the first version will be released. Until then if anyone would like to share interesting assets or help in game development please contact us on our discord. 
Greetings and have a nice game :)
